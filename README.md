# mbnet_analysis
This repository contains data analysis scripts for Ray, Aldworth and Stopfer, 2019.


The scripts expect folders containing data files in `../simulated/` directory. 
To reproduce the figures from the simulation data (assuming your current directory is where you cloned this repository)
 1. create the directory `../simulated`
 2. extract contents of the zipped data files accompanying this publication into the directory `../simulated `
 3. create the directory `../figures` where the scripts dump the generated figure files
 4. run the scripts from this (`mbnet_analysis`) directory
